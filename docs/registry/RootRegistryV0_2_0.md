### getVersionForContractName(string,int256)

**Execution cost**: No bound available

**Attributes**: constant


Params:

1. **_contractName** *of type `string`*

    > String name of a contract (ie Registry)

2. **_index** *of type `int256`*

    > the proxy contract's positional index inside of 'versions'. Pass -1 to get the latest proxy's history (in most cases, you should default to this), or a particular index to get the particular history for a given index. Note: The first index (0) is only used pre-initialization and is not a valid version (0_0_0) nor implementation address (0x0). If you want the earliest index, pass: _index = 1


Returns:

### setVersion(string,address,string,address)
>
>Sets a version for a particular contract by assigning a contract name an associated proxy, version name (using SemVer 2.0) and its logic implementation

> This function can only be used by a particular contract's proxy.


**Execution cost**: No bound available


Params:

1. **_contractName** *of type `string`*

    > String name of a contract (ie Registry)

2. **_proxyAddress** *of type `address`*

    > the Proxy contract's address

3. **_versionName** *of type `string`*

    > the version name (which MUST be incremented each time new logic is set) using SemVer 2.0

4. **_newImplementation** *of type `address`*

    > the contract containing the logic of the proposed contract name



--- 
### setVersionAsAdmin(string,address,string,address)
>
>Sets a version for a particular contract by assigning a contract name an associated proxy, version name (using SemVer 2.0) and its logic implementation
>
> This function can only be used by the admin. Additionally, it is not recomended to ever use this function unless you truly understand the implications it has inside the proxy contract and this registry alike. In most cases, the only appropriate time to use this function is during the very first registration of a contract at a proxy. In all other cases, the `setVersion` function should be called directly from the proxy's `upgradeTo` or `upgradeToAndCall` function (both of which will not work until this function was used during the FIRST deployment/registration of the proxy).


**Execution cost**: No bound available


Params:

    > the version name (which MUST be incremented each time new logic is set) using SemVer 2.0

4. **_newImplementation** *of type `address`*

    > the contract containing the logic of the proposed contract name
