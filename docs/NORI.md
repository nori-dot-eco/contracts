## NORI







---

### initialize

```solidity
function initialize() public
```






### __NORI_init

```solidity
function __NORI_init() internal
```

Initializer variant that embeds the linearized calls to all parent initializers.

_Follows the multiple inheritance initializer rules defined [here](
https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/upgradeable#multiple-inheritance). As a consequence,
calling two of these init functions can potentially initialize the same contract twice._



### __NORI_init_unchained

```solidity
function __NORI_init_unchained() internal
```

Initializer variant that does **not** embed linearized calls to any parent initializers.

_Follows the multiple inheritance initializer rules defined [here](
https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/upgradeable#multiple-inheritance). As a consequence,
calling two of these init functions can potentially initialize the same contract twice._
