/**
 * @title Nori Inc.'s carbon removal marketplace.
 * @author Nori Inc.
 * @notice Facilitates the exchange of ERC20 with permit tokens for a non-transferrable certificate of carbon removal.
 * @dev Carbon removals are represented by ERC1155 tokens in the Removal contract, where the balance of a
 * given token represents the number of tonnes of carbon that were removed from the atmosphere for that specific
 * removal (different token IDs are used to represent different slices of carbon removal projects and years).
 * This contract facilitates the exchange of ERC20 tokens for ERC721 tokens managed by the Certificate contract.
 * Each of these certificates is a non-transferrable, non-fungible token that owns the specific removal tokens
 * and token balances that comprise the specific certificate for the amount purchased.
 *
 * The market maintains a "priority restricted threshold", which is a configurable threshold of supply that is
 * always reserved to sell only to buyers who have the `ALLOWLIST_ROLE`.  Purchases that would drop supply below
 * this threshold will revert without the correct role.
 *
 * ###### Additional behaviors and features
 *
 * - [Upgradeable](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/upgradeable)
 * - [Pausable](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/security#Pausable): all external functions that mutate
 * state are pausable.
 * - [Role-based access control](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/access-control)
 * - `MARKET_ADMIN_ROLE`: Can set the fee percentage, fee wallet address, and priority restricted threshold.
 * - `ALLOWLIST_ROLE`: Can purchase from priority restricted supply.
 * - [Can receive ERC1155 tokens](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/token/erc1155#IERC1155Receiver)
