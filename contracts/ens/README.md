# ENS

## Formal Specifications

- [Ethereum Domain Name Service](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-137.md)

## Background

These contracts were taken from the [official ENS repository](https://github.com/ensdomains/ens/tree/master/contracts) as a means to deploy ENS to ganache so that we can more closely mock a production environment during testing.

Domains by environment:

- Production (mainnet): `norimarket.eth`. This is owned, but not currently configured.
- Staging (ropsten): `nori.test`. This is owned by the MultiAdmin wallet, and is currently resolving to the RootRegistry at address `0x9d9403c9a3217f13a672fc36b204edb10d321110`
- Development (truffle/ganache development): `nori.eth` will be registered at a different ENS deployment each time you restart your truffle environment
- Testing (test): a new ens deployment will be created and torn down for each test (in most cases) and `nori.eth` will be used to resolve the latest RootRegistry.

## Purpose

ENS is used as a way of easivly protecting/detecting modifications to the dapps contracts. Since all contracts are transitively derived from the RootRegistry, we assign the ENS domain to resolve to the RootRegistry address, and we end up with a human readable domain that serves as a routing mechanism for contracts in the Nori ecosystem.

## Key features

- Resolves (routes/points) to the RootRegistry Address
